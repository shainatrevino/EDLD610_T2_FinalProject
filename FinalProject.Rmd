The following dataset is de-identified and already hosted on Github. The data come from one of my recent publications (Experiment 1; Miller, Gross, & Unsworth, 2019). In this paper, pupil dilation was used as an index of the intensity of attention to determine if variation in attention at encoding partially accounts for the relation between working memory capacity (WMC) and long-term memory (LTM). Participants (*N* = 138) completed a battery of complex span working memory tasks, followed by a delayed free recall task while pupil dilation was simultaneously recorded.

```{r load_data}

data <- import(here("data", "DeIntentifiedJML2019Data_Exp1.sav"),
               setclass = "tibble") %>% 
  characterize() %>%

#ST minor note: it is also possible to import the data directly from your github using a link instead of putting the file in your project

*Also, for those trying to reproduce this document, just a heads up that it will probably take at least 5 minutes to generate the html because of the animated plots!*

### Plot 1

Here I plot changes in pupil diameter across the 3 second study/encoding phase for each word (i.e., bin).

  + Fig. 4 in Miller, Gross, & Unsworth (2019).
     + **Identification of the intended audience:** Scientific community
     + **The intended message to be communicated:** When instructed to study a list of words, pupil diameter increases throughout the study phase for each word. This increase in pupil dilation is believed to reflect an increase in the amount of attentional effort devoted to a given item.

```{r tidy_data_plot1}

# Tidy data:
plot1_data <- pupil_data %>%
  gather(key = word_bin, value = TEPR, w1_bin1:w10_bin15) %>%
  separate(word_bin, c("word", "bin"), sep = "_") %>%
  mutate(word = parse_number(word),
         bin = parse_number(bin)) %>%
  arrange(subject)

#ST I have never seen this package for calculating se, I usually do it in multiple steps. I will be using this in the future - thanks!

### Plot 2

Here I plot pupil diameter as a function of serial position for high WMC (*n* = 33), medium WMC (*n* = 69) and low WMC (*n* = 31) individuals.

  + Fig. 5 in Miller, Gross, & Unsworth (2019)
      + **Identification of the intended audience:** Scientific community
      + **The intended message to be communicated:** Different patterns of pupil dilation across serial positions emerge based on one's working memory capacity (WMC). Namely, for high WMC individuals (*n* = 33), pupil diameter **increases** as each new word is introduced during the learning phase of the task. Alternatively, for low WMC individuals (*n* = 31), pupil diameter **decreases** as each new word is introducted during learning.
    
```{r tidy_data_plot2, fig.height=5, fig.width=6.5, fig.align='center'}

#Reordering factor levels for legend
plot1_data$span_group <- factor(plot1_data$span_group, 
                                levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))

plot2data <- plot1_data %>%
  group_by(word, span_group) %>%
  summarise(mean_TEPR = mean(TEPR, na.rm = TRUE),
            se_TEPR = sundry::se(TEPR))

# Rename variable for legend
plot2data %<>% 
  rename("WMC" = `span_group`)

#Specify colors for my own color palette
vapor_wave <- c("violetred4", "pink", "turquoise4") #ST I love how you created this vector to use to scale fill - I will be using this.

plot2 <- ggplot(plot2data, aes(x = word, y = mean_TEPR)) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = mean_TEPR - 1.96*se_TEPR, 
                    ymax = mean_TEPR + 1.96*se_TEPR,
                    fill = WMC),
                    alpha = 0.4) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = vapor_wave) +
    #scale_fill_carto_d(palette = "Burg") +

    #ST added caption setting to dark theme instead of specifying again

    labs(caption = "Figure 2. Pupillary response across serial positions for low working memory capacity (WMC) individuals

           y = "Mean Pupil Diameter (mm)",
           x = "Serial position",
           colour = "WMC") +

                                 "6", "7", "8", "9", "10"))

```

### Plot 3

Now I will attempt to plot pupil diameter as a function of serial position (broken down into Primacy (words 1–3), Mid (words 4–7), and Recency (words 8–10)) and bin (time across the 3 second study phase for each word) based on one's WMC. 

+ Fig. 6 in Miller, Gross, & Unsworth (2019)
    + **Identification of the intended audience:** Scientific community
    + **The intended message to be communicated:** This figure essentially conveys the same information as the figure above. For high WMC individuals, pupil dilation continues to gradually increase throughout the encoding period for all serial positions, with primacy items (the first few words presented during list presentation; words 1-3) displaying smaller dilations than mid (words 4–7) and recency items (the last few words presented during list presentation; words 8–10). Conversely, low WMC individuals show moderate increases in dilation that appear to plateau near the middle of the encoding period. Moreover, pupil dilation appears to be largest for primacy items and smallest for recency items, despite a gradual increase in dilation for recency items.

```{r plot3_tidy1, fig.align='center'}

# Converting word # to factors
plot1_data$word <- as.factor(plot1_data$word)

# Breaking down words into primacy, mid, and recency items
plot3_data <- plot1_data %>% 
  mutate(word = recode(word, '1' = "Primacy Items",
                             '2' = "Primacy Items",
                             '3' = "Primacy Items",
                             '4' = "Mid Items",
                             '5' = "Mid Items", 
                             '6' = "Mid Items",
                             '7' = "Mid Items",
                             '8' = "Recency Items",
                             '9' = "Recency Items",
                            '10' = "Recency Items")) #ST Great use of recode, I usually use case_when, but this is much more efficient!

```

Above I faceted by serial position (primacy, mid, recency). In Miller et al. (2019), I actually faceted by WMC (low, mid, high). I honestly don't know which method I prefer. For comparision sake, let's try to reproduce the plot faceting by WMC:

  + Remember, the point this graph is trying to make is that when instructed to study a list of words for a later test, two factors seem to influence how attention is allocated across the study phase (as indexed via pupil dilation): (1) one's WMC and (2) serial position. For high WMC individuals, pupil dilation continues to gradually increase throughout the encoding period for all serial positions, with primacy items (the first few words presented during list presentation; words 1-3) displaying smaller dilations than mid (words 4–7) and recency items (the last few words presented during list presentation; words 8–10). Conversely, low WMC individuals show moderate increases in dilation that appear to plateau near the middle of the encoding period. Moreover, pupil dilation appears to be largest for primacy items and smallest for recency items, despite a gradual increase in dilation for recency items.

### Plot 4

Here I attempt to plot relation between recall accuracy and strategy type.

  + **Identification of the intended audience:** General public
  + **The intended message to be communicated:** Strategies that rely on more elaborative mental processes are associated with better memory performance
